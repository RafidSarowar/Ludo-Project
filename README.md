# Ludo-Project
Recreating the board game Ludo in C++ — a project that combines advanced programming concepts with a piece of my childhood.


💡 Why This Project Matters

This wasn’t just an assignment — it’s a highlight of my programming journey.
I challenged myself to implement rules, file systems, and algorithms while keeping gameplay fun.
At the same time, it carries an emotional note: recreating a childhood game in code reminded me how far I’ve come in both learning and life.

## 🚀 Features
- Supports **2–4 players** with 2 tokens each  
- **Dice mechanics** with a “triple six = lose turn” rule  
- **Cut rule**: capture opponent’s token and send it home  
- **Game stats & leaderboards**: tracks moves, cuts, turns, sorted with Bubble & Selection Sort  
- **File I/O**: saves game logs and leaderboards  
- Demonstrates **core C++ concepts**:  
  - Arrays & vectors  
  - Functions (pass by value & reference, overloading, default args)  
  - Searching & sorting algorithms  
  - Control structures (`if`, `switch`, loops)  
  - Static variables, type casting, formatted output
